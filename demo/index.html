    <h2>Confirmation Letter</h2>
    <p>
        Hi {{customerName}}!
    </p>
    <p>
        Congratulations on protecting your confirmed travel or event plans with a WeatherPromise! Your WeatherPromise is
        described in this Confirmation Letter and the attached WeatherPromise Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You have purchased a Daily WeatherPromise.</strong>
        <br />
        That means that subject to the WeatherPromise Terms and Conditions, we will pay you {{reimbursementAmount}} for
        the
        second and each subsequent day that it rains more than {{maxRainfallAmount}} inches. No payout is due for the
        first
        such day. Your WeatherPromise will be in effect starting on {{startDate}} and ending on {{endDate}}, including
        those
        days.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will automatically watch the weather. If we owe you a payout, subject to the attached Terms and Conditions,
        we will
        reach out to you directly at {{customerEmail}} to facilitate the payout. You don’t even have to worry about
        contacting
        us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Weather observations and payment calculations for {{locationName}} are based on:
